# BINARY SEARCH TREE
___
Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.

### HOW IT WORKS

This program has two classes;

* BinarySearchTree.java
* Run.java


#### BinarySearchTree class
This class has the following constructors

* Node
* delete_Recursive
* minValue
* insert
* insert_Recursive
* inorder
* inorder_Recursive
* search
* search_Recursive

#### Run.jav class
This class defines the MAIN method (driver method).
It controls all the parts of the program.
It performs the following functions:

* inserts data into bninary tree to make an intial tree
* implement the delete function 
* search for an element


### RUN CODE
To run the this program.  
* Create two class (BinarySearchTree.java, Run.java)
* Copy the contents of each classes and paste in their respective classes
* Run.
